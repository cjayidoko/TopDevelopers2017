## Installation: 
The codes .ipynb files in this repository run on any Anaconda installed Python 3.0. The .png figures can open device that support .png images. 

## Project Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is to find out the most admirable career paths among the many developer jobs out there.   I utilized a dataset of survey from stack overflow developers in 2017, The developers come from over 213 countries with my analytic focus on developers from the United States (US). Three important questions were answered:
1. Which are the most attractive developer roles in the US in 2017?.
2. Is expeerience coding akin to high pay among developers?
3. What tools do top paid developers use?.

## File Descriptions:
The dataset utilized for this study are owned by Udacity, and thus not publicly available. The datasets are two: a survey dataset, and a schema describing the questions posed for each column in the survey.  This repository include the  Jupiter Noteboks 'IdokoCM_DataSc_Project1.ipynb ' which contains the break-down of my work and 'drop_down.ipynb ' which is a function that can be used to get an equivalent drop down of responses in a target_column that match the results of splitting multiple responses in a given pseudo_column. Other files in the repository are image/figure results from the analysis. 

## Results: 
The findings of this study are summarized in the blog post [here](https://medium.com/@idokochijioke/secrets-to-having-the-most-admirable-career-as-a-developer-8de8b0a98d69).
